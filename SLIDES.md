# Growing an Elm app with the whole team

What we learned about each other on the journey

- Developer for over a decade
- Previously worked in another industry
- Had some kids
- Noticed some things about how we work together and how we treat each other
- "Be nice" might be a boring message but I'm hoping to demonstrate why we need to say it.
- A lot of my talk will be common sense - but the point of it is to give teams and people the confidence to make the effort to enforce a "be nice" atmosphere and some practical tips on how and why.
- What follows is a based on real events, but not the real people...

Note:
- Intro me

## 2 years ago...

- How I got to Elm 2 years ago - basically was suspiscious/ terrified of javascript
- We had some ups and downs but we built a thing

+++

## All happily going about our work
- One year on... Success... remote lead need to roll out clones, no developers available
- My available team (PIC - with labels)
- PIC - 10x engineer, rockstar, gnome - all busy... manager thinks we need to port the app!
- "Is there anything anyone needs help with?" Eureka

Note:
- labeled team

+++

## Knowledge?
- I realised: All different people with different knowledge, interests and levels of experience
- easy to hurt each other's feelings / judge each other's tech
- base 64
- a11y
- the project lead is probably not the best at anything
- Together we can build a thing, right?

## Stumbling down the path...

- One fine day

+++

## Beginners welcome
- CODE: psuedo code and placeholders are great - with a few rules, none of that will make it to production.
- CODE: New developers and non-developers productive quickly. Why/ how Elm helps. relatedInfo == example?
- Process for onboarding team members - what do they need to know?
- Pull request review guidelines. easier in Elm. Gives newcomers more confidence. (e.g. changes to the model, does it introduce duplication? feldman elm conf 2018, naming Ally Elm 2018, unipod strategy elm eu 2019)
- London Elm code night woman - "Only coding meetup that said beginners welcome"
- No more need to know how ot configure a postfix server than we do need to know how to write safe js in order to be good at our jobs (Charlie star inn)
- REMOVE?: (Elm framework does not get in the way)
- REMOVE?: (Much of engineering constraints taken care of by constraints of Elm)

## Everyone's voice - team style not indy style
- CODE: Collaboration means everything should not be in your style and the project's style should evolve
- PIC: Tom after a year - seems like all we do every day is go round in circles rewriting each other's code in our own style
- Declarative style of Elm allows people to discover own "how". Many routes to same endpoint. Give everyone ownership of own journey - don;t instruct people on how, give them a framework that guides them.
- MOVE? (Remember - some things are easy for some people "Even a female baby could do that!")
- If you label something as X... people will be lazy about assigning value/ use cases to it. If you don't label, people use own experience/ imagination.
- More people in the team means less burden on the individual. can be outside of core team and be there for bouncing ideas off occassionally or jump in when deadlines loom.
- We don't often put user needs of devs to top priority of scoping. e.g. better install docs, less assumptions of project specific knowledge
- Everyone's voice is valid. Sometimes with less knowledge, we can point out a much simpler way. Especially if we are looking at a small part of the big picture in collaboration. More overview sometimes makes it seem more complicated than it needs to be.
- CODE: Tick / Sync model - Nick mentioned, then 2 years later elm EU games
- MOVE?: (What is the value in being competative? Co-production is the opposite of heroic leadership.)

## Language forms culture

+++

## Code for people
- refactor/ review should focus on maknig easier for everyone
- experienced developers have more trouble reading Elm than beginners
- CODE: Functional peices are atomic. Someone can fix/ implement a part without knowing the whole. No hidden effects, nuances.
- We are humans, not robots. Our efficiancy needs are different to theirs. PIC - "Mum you are not a computer"
- CODE: Easy to read the code and see what it does. No behind the scenes functional magic. More predicatble. the only magic is turning it into js.
- CODE: Invest time in modelling your use case up front. Noisy boiler plate not always helpful.
- Think about the future readers and writers of your codebase

## Nature of bugs
- Translation framework turned out to be a useful step on way to branding

## Started to see the light...

Note:
- Starts to make you happy... sooner

## What we can do as a community

- labels don't help <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-blue" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- all of our knowledge is different and valuable <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-yellow" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- inclusiveness helps <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="3" -->
