- Developer for over a decade
- Previously worked in another industry
- Had some kids
- Noticed some things about how we work together and how we treat each other
- "Be nice" might be a boring message but I'm hoping to demonstrate why we need to say it.
- A lot of my talk will be common sense - but the point of it is to give teams and people the confidence to make the effort to enforce a "be nice" atmosphere and some practical tips on how and why.
- What follows is a based on real events, but not the real people...

## Once upon a time...

- How I got to Elm 2 years ago - basically was suspiscious/ terrified of javascript
- Once year on... remote lead need to roll out clones, no developers available
- My available team (pic - with labels)
- pic - 10x engineer, rockstar, we need to port the app!
- "Is there anything anyone needs help with?" Eureka
- I realised: All different people with different knowledge, interests and levels of experience
- Together we can build a thing
- base 64
- a11y
- the project lead is probably not the best at anything

Note:
- Intro me

## All happily going about our work...

- image of labeled team
- trying to collaborate to get to a whole thing
- problem is we are all different with levels of knowlegde, interests and experience - different passions etc
- easy to make assumptions and hurt feelings
